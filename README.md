This repository contains samples of my work as a business analyst for projects during my master's at the University of Bristol.

The two projects were:

1. **Analysing customer Churn and Annual Revenue data for a B2B SaaS firm** based in India to provide actionable insights
     This project was carried out in PowerBi and the dashboard for this can be found in this repo as the "Saas_firm_Dashboard.pbix".
     The insights and feedback were compiled in a presentation and added in this repo as the "Saas_Firm_Insights" PPT.
     It also included scenarios that needed DAX queries which are added to the PPT.
   
2. **Analysing sales and customer data for a SME based in Bristol, UK**
   This project was carried out in Python and the code file has been added to this repo as the "MintPlants_Python.ipynb".
   The insights derived and recommendations are in the presentation and added to this repo as the "MintPlants_FinalPPT".
